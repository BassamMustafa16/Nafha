        Nafha Thabet is a haute couture brand born from a deep reverence for
        bold femininity, sculptural elegance, and fearless self-expression.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg xl:text-xl">
        Each piece is a celebration of individuality, meticulously designed and
        hand-crafted to empower women to stand tall in their truth.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg xl:text-xl">
        Inspired by the strength, resilience, and beauty found in women from all
        walks of life, Nafha Thabet creates more than fashion; it creates
        moments.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg xl:text-xl">
        The brand rejects narrow standards and embraces diversity, honoring
        every woman’s shape, story, and spirit.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg xl:text-xl">
        At its core, Nafha Thabet is about redefining couture. We don’t follow
        trends, we tell stories. We believe fashion is a powerful language, one
        that allows women to express independence, confidence, and authenticity.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm lg:text-lg xl:text-xl">
        Our designs are made for those who dare to stand out, step forward, and
        wear their power with pride.
